# Detailed Code Documentation

---

## 1. Overview

This code implements a basic lexer and parser for a simple programming language. The lexer is responsible for breaking the input into tokens, while the parser interprets these tokens and checks if variables and functions are used correctly. The supported language includes basic arithmetic operations and declarations of variables and functions.

## 2. Code Structure

The code is written in the V programming language and is organized into four main components:

1. **Lexer**: Class responsible for identifying and generating tokens from the input.
2. **Environment**: Class that stores declared variables and functions.
3. **Parser**: Class that interprets tokens and performs validation of variable and function declarations and usage.
4. **Main Function**: Initializes the lexer and parser, and performs the analysis of the input code.

## 3. Code Components

### 3.1. Lexer

- **Description**: The `Lexer` is responsible for reading the input character by character and generating corresponding tokens.
- **Methods**:
  - `new_lexer(input string) &Lexer`: Creates a new instance of the lexer.
  - `read_char()`: Reads the next character from the input.
  - `next_token() Token`: Generates the next token from the input.
  - `read_identifier() string`: Reads a sequence of characters that form an identifier.
  - `read_number() string`: Reads a sequence of characters that form a number.
  - `skip_whitespace()`: Skips whitespace characters.
  
- **Enumerations**:
  - `TokenType`: Defines token types such as `ident`, `int`, `assign`, etc.

### 3.2. Environment

- **Description**: The `Environment` keeps track of declared variables and functions.
- **Methods**:
  - `new_environment() &Environment`: Creates a new instance of the environment.
  - `declare_variable(name string)`: Declares a new variable.
  - `declare_function(name string)`: Declares a new function.
  - `is_variable_declared(name string) bool`: Checks if a variable has been declared.
  - `is_function_declared(name string) bool`: Checks if a function has been declared.

### 3.3. Parser

- **Description**: The `Parser` interprets the sequence of tokens generated by the lexer and validates whether the code is correct in terms of variable and function declarations and usage.
- **Methods**:
  - `new_parser(lexer &Lexer) &Parser`: Creates a new instance of the parser.
  - `parse()`: Performs a full analysis of the code.
  - `next_token()`: Moves to the next token in the sequence.

### 3.4. Main Function

- **Description**: The main function (`main`) initializes the lexer and parser with an input code and starts the analysis process.
- **Code**:
  ```v
  fn main() {
      input := 'let five = 5;\nlet ten = 10;\nlet add = fn(x, y) {\n  x + y;\n};\nlet result = add(five, ten);\n'
      l := new_lexer(input)
      mut p := new_parser(l)

      p.next_token() // Initialize the parser with the first token
      p.parse()
  }
  ```

## 4. Usage Example

To test the code, run the program with an input string containing variables and functions. The lexer will analyze the input, and the parser will validate if the declarations are correct and if variables are used properly.

## 5. Technical Details

- **Language**: The code is written in the V programming language.
- **Dependencies**: There are no external dependencies other than the standard library of the V language.
- **Input Format**: The input to the lexer should be a string containing the code of the language to be analyzed.

## 6. Final Considerations

This code provides a basic implementation of a lexer and parser and can be extended to support additional language features, such as additional operators, flow control, and more complex data types. The documentation and code are designed to provide a solid foundation for building more advanced compilers or interpreters.
